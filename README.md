# 🌀 SwappyBox

SwappyBox is a fun and experimental take on financial options combined with dynamic auctions and gamified speculation. Think of it as a tradeable right to buy cryptos at a fixed price (strike price), but with a twist — the right itself can be bid on and swapped by others, and only the final holder can exercise it. Intermediate holders can profit by just flipping their position!

## 🧠 What is SwappyBox?

SwappyBox is a decentralized protocol where:

- **Initiators** lock cryptos and define a **strike price** (USD value).
- This creates a **"Box"** — a tradable contract that grants the right to buy that cryptos at the strike price before a deadline.
- The **Box** can be bought and sold — but only at a higher price than the last bid or the AMM-estimated demand price.
- **Each new bidder pays a higher price**, and the **previous holder profits** from the difference.
- The **final holder** at expiration can choose to exercise the option or let it expire.

## 🚀 Why SwappyBox?

Traditional options are rigid, slightly centralized, and not fun to use. SwappyBox brings (note it not option but similar to option):

- 💸 **Open access** to earn from speculation.
- 🧠 **Game-like bidding** wars and box sniping.
- 🔁 **Dynamic ownership** — box moves only when someone outbids the current holder.
- 📈 **Pool initiators earn passive income**: 0.5% fee from each bid transaction.

## 🛠️ What Problem Does It Solve?

- **Barrier to options trading** is high — SwappyBox makes it accessible and interactive.
- **Speculation is dry** — we add a **fun twist**, letting users trade positions, not just assets.
- **Lack of incentivized dynamic pricing** — our AMM logic ensures demand affects pricing, reducing sniping and underbidding.

## 🎯 Example Flow

1. **Alice** creates a SwappyBox with:
   - 1 crypto(WND) deposit
   - Strike Price: $2000 (assume 1 WND = $2000 like ETH)
   - Expiry: 7 days

2. **Bob** buys the box for **$10** (1% of Crypto(WND) value).

3. **Charlie** bids **$20**:
   - Box moves to Charlie.
   - Bob makes **$10 profit**.

4. More bidders enter — demand rises.

5. **AMM sets new price floor at $50** due to high activity.

6. **Dave** tries bidding **$30** → **rejected**.

7. **Eve** bids **$55** → **accepted**, box moves to her.

8. On expiry:
   - Eve pays $2000 → receives 1 WND.
   - Or does nothing → box expires, Eve loses $55.
